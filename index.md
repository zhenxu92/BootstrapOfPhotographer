# Welcome come to a bootstrap to become a photographer

I've always admired that people who can shoot photos that are stunning, in many ways. I cannot articulate the reasons because, in fact, it's very hard to define a good photographer or to categorized them. Photographers created complex set of work in reflection of themselves, just like paintings, music are actually painters and composers. They let you see the world in their eyes so that you can broaden your views of the world and maybe let some scene become a part of your mind.

Well, I am not professional but an amateur myself. I wrote this partially to myself as a research, but you may find it interesting and useful.


## Career Research

### - General research into salaries and so on

Nowadays, high paying job are mostly associated with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics(STEM) majors. Attentions are paid more compared to other less popular majors like Arts, Politics, Social Studies. Intuitively, jobs related to those majors should not be as high as STEMs, but what are the real numbers.

According to a recent study. Most of the jobs under Art section has salaries that are lower than average in the US. It's worth mentioning that all the fields of study that you have been interested in do not have relatively high salaries, including Psychology, Social Work music and Fine Art.
