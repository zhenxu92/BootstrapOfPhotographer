# Welcome come to a bootstrap to become a photographer

I've always admired that people who can shoot photos that are stunning, in many ways. I cannot articulate the reasons because, in fact, it's very hard to define a good photographer or to categorized them. Photographers created complex set of work in reflection of themselves, just like paintings, music are actually painters and composers. They let you see the world in their eyes so that you can broaden your views of the world and maybe let some scene become a part of your mind.

Well, I am not professional but an amateur myself. I wrote this partially to myself as a research, but you may find it interesting and useful.
