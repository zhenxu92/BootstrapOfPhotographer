# Welcome come to a bootstrap to become a photographer

I've always admired that people who can shoot photos that are stunning, in many ways. I cannot articulate the reasons because, in fact, it's very hard to define a good photographer or to categorized them. Photographers created complex set of work in reflection of themselves, just like paintings, music are actually painters and composers. They let you see the world in their eyes so that you can broaden your views of the world and maybe let some scene become a part of your mind.

Well, I am not professional but an amateur myself. I wrote this partially to myself as a research, but you may find it interesting and useful.


## Career Research

### - General research into salaries and so on

Nowadays, high paying job are mostly associated with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics(STEM) majors. Attentions are paid more compared to other less popular majors like Arts, Politics, Social Studies. Intuitively, jobs related to those majors should not be as high as STEMs, but what are the real numbers.

According to a recent study. Most of the jobs under Art section has salaries that are lower than average in the US. It's worth mentioning that all the fields of study that you have been interested in do not have relatively high salaries, including Psychology, Social Work music and Fine Art.

### - Comparison

I am very glad that there are actually so many resources over there that you can barely learn them all, especially online resources. Personally, I have some collections of tutorials but I find it more comprehensive in [this](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-photography-1).

You may want to search on Udacity and Udemy or simply just Google if there is any good local classes. All the good resources that I prepared will be gathered under "Resources" section.

There are many possible MFA programs, some good programs that are directly related to Photography:

1. [Photographic & Electronic Media MFA](https://www.mica.edu/Programs_of_Study/Graduate_Programs/Photographic_and_Electronic_Media_(MFA).html), Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland.

## Words at the End

Forgive me that I use webpage format as the media to convey those information to you, partly because I think that I want to provide as much as I can to you, but I think I also do it selfishly that I want to practice some static website blogging skills :). Hopefully, it is not overwhelming but useful enough.

### Conclusion
I did research in the last couple of days and basically have an idea on how photography can change your way of life. You really have passion for photographing and had already done some great jobs. However, being a professional photographer is a different thing. I cannot come to a conclusion to you saying that you can be or you cannot be a pro-photographer, but I should tell you all the facts that I know to you.

Currently, you are considering about going to an school to learn more and possibly get a degree on photography, increasing the chance that you can start a good career on it. I would say that is one good direction. If you checked all the MFA programs that I listed above, there are some programs provide good practice and intern chances to students. Those might be good kickstarts for you, but on the other hand, those programs will cause you about at least $10K to finish excluding the fees that you want to live a quality life during your time of study. There is always a trade-off, but it's your choice.

Good photographer needs years of practice, so you should be prepared. You might also learn all the skills needed and horn them in a long time. One day, your picture could be one of the best in world. Compared to professional study in photography, you might not know some crucial knowledge about the art of photography, together with some career opportunities. If you would like to consider photography as a part-time job, you can definitely succeed in photographing, but it may take more exercise.

As we all know, even if you are good at taking photos one day, the income could still be unstable for a while. You should know that becoming a professional photographer is not just about skills, it's also about social-networking. You need to know how to run a business and control your cash flow. You might experience some hard time, but it's fine since there are always people that can support you. Don't worry about it :)!

All you need is that if you made a choice, be persistent with it.
